# The FLAMES Game

Flames was first played on paper, but thanks to technology, we now have online variations of the game. Being able to test your FLAMES with someone without having to look for the paper again is amazing.

There are many different interpretations of the significance of the individual letters that make up the acronym. Some claim it is:

- FLAME: Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies
- FLAMES: stands for - Friends, Lover, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, Sister
- FLAMES: Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy and Siblings
- FLAMES: Friends, Lovers, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, ‘Secret Lovers’ \* and more

## How to play the game

The game first start’s by writing you and your partner’s name on a piece of paper, though not compulsory, it is better to use your full names. As you can see in the input boxes below, there are two names, the first is your name and the second is your partner’s name.

Then, we cancel out the common letters in both names; each instance of a letter in the first person’s name will cancel out a letter in the second person’s name

After cancelling out the common letters in both names, we now combine the letters which were not cancelled.

Then, we count the number of the letters which were not cancelled. Take note of the number

In our example, the number of letters which were not cancelled is 10.

Now, we get the modular 6 of that number. The reason is that, incase the number is greater than 6, which is the number of letters in the acronym FLAMES, it will round it back to a number which is less than 6.

The modular 10 of 6 is 4

We now compare the answer which we got to this little table
| Number | Letter | Relationship |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | F | Friends |
| 1 | L | Love |
| 2 | A | Affection |  
| 3 | M | Marriage |  
| 4 | E | Enemy |  
| 5 | S | Siblings |
